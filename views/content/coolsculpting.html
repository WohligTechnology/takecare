          <h2 class="brand-primary text-uppercase font-semibold">Freeze away fat</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">It comes down to science. Fat cells freeze at higher temperatures than surrounding tissues.  CoolSculpting technology safely delivers precisely controlled cooling to gently and effectively target the fat cells underneath the skin. The treated fat cells are crystallized (frozen), and then die. Over time, your body naturally processes the fat and eliminates these dead cells, leaving a more sculpted you.</p>

          <h2 class="brand-primary text-uppercase font-semibold">How it works?</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">It’s easy to sit back, relax and say goodbye to stubborn fat. After we select the area(s) to be treated, the device is positioned on your body and controlled cooling is applied. During your procedure, you may choose to read, check email, or even take a nap. The CoolSculpting fat freezing procedure is completely non-surgical, so you can typically return to work and normal activities immediately. You will like what you see. In the weeks and months following your procedure, your body naturally processes the fat and eliminates these dead cells. Once the treated fat cells are gone, they're gone for good.</p>
