        <p class="text-justify white health-descp">All diets fail when they become boring. After all how long can you live on boiled veggies and dry roti? Suman Agarwal conceived of Selfcare when she observed that obesity was fast getting to be a global issue and even though different solutions have been sought, researched and tried out, the results were short-lived. Suman set out looking for a solution where weight loss and a fit body were synonymous and where the individual could stick to his or her choice of foods, after becoming aware of healthy food choices. At Selfcare, Suman designs diet formulae where food is an important indulgence. And it works. An amateur classical and western dancer, classical singer and passionate about everything she does, including her personal experiments with food, Suman has a panache for languages and loves devouring and adding books to her well-stocked library. When she is not immersed in the art of food and health management, Suman has fun managing her home and spending time with her husband and three daughters.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify descp">The difference in Suman's style of work not only comes from her background as a certified nutritionist (Certificate Course in Food and Nutrition, Oxford University, U.K (Aff)), and a qualified fitness trainer from the National Institute of Aerobics (Certificate Course in Fitness from NIA), but also from the intense research she has done in the field of diet and medicine and her inherent interest in each person she encounters.
